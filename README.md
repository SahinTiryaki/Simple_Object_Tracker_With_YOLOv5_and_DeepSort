# Simple Person Tracker with Yolov5 + Deep Sort 




## Introduction

This repository contains a highly configurable two-stage-tracker that adjusts to different deployment scenarios. The detections generated by [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to a [Deep Sort algorithm](https://github.com/ZQPei/deep_sort_pytorch) which combines motion and appearance information.

## To Run

1. Clone the repository recursively:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_OSNet.git`

If you already cloned and forgot to use `--recurse-submodules` you can run `git submodule update --init`

2. Make sure that you fulfill all the requirements: Python 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies installed, including torch>=1.7. To install, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Yolov5

There is a clear trade-off between model inference speed and accuracy. In order to make it possible to fulfill your inference speed/accuracy needs
you can select a Yolov5 family model for automatic download



```bash


$ python track.py --source 0 --yolo_model yolov5n.pt --img 640 --classes 0
                                          yolov5s.pt
                                          yolov5m.pt
                                          yolov5l.pt 
                                          yolov5x.pt --img 1280
                                          ...
```
